This website is based on a flask application, an html page, an ajax request, a java request based on classes generated by a .wsdl file, and stylesheet to enhance user experience. 

The app.py file : Python Flask web application that serves an HTML template ('check_vat.html') on the '/' route, and accepts a GET request on the '/check_vat' route with two parameters: country_code and vat_number. It runs a Java program 'vatjava.Main' with these parameters and captures the output. If the Java program returns a non-zero exit code, the error message is captured. The output is decoded as a UTF-8 string and returned as plain text. This application can be used to check the validity of a VAT number for a given country.

The main.java : This is a Java program that uses the CheckVatPortType SOAP web service to validate a VAT (Value Added Tax) code. Here's a description of the code: 
1 / Import the required Java libraries:java.util.Scanner: 
used to read input from the command line. 
javax.xml.ws.Holder: used to hold the input/output values for the SOAP web service. 
javax.xml.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendar: used to handle the date/time values. 
2 /Define the Main class.
In the main() method:
Create a new instance of the CheckVatService.
Get the CheckVatPortType instance from the service.
Read the country code and VAT number from the command line using Scanner.
Create a new CheckVat object and set the country code and VAT number.
Create Holder objects for the input/output values required by the SOAP web service.
Call the checkVat() method on the CheckVatPortType instance with the input Holder objects.
Check the output values returned by the checkVat() method and print the results to the console.
The program prompts the user to enter a country code and a VAT number. Then it calls the checkVat() method of the SOAP web service with these inputs and outputs the result to the console. If the VAT code is valid, the program prints the name and address of the company associated with the VAT code. If the VAT code is invalid, the program outputs a message saying so.

The javascript file : The checkVat() function is a JavaScript function that sends a request to a server-side endpoint to verify a VAT number for a given country. It takes two parameters, countryCode and vatNumber, which are obtained from two input fields in an HTML form.

The sytle file : CSS code snippet that styles a web page with a form and a background image. 

The html file : This is an HTML code for a web page that allows users to check their European VAT (Value Added Tax) number. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:
